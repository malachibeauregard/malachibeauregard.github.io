        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Malachi Beauregard, and Iâ€™m currently an MLB Data Analyst, where I apply advanced analytical techniques to help teams make data-driven decisions that impact player performance, game strategies, and overall team success. With a background in mathematics, statistics, and computer science, I use cutting-edge tools and methodologies to provide actionable insights into player and team dynamics. My areas of expertise include player evaluation, game prediction models, advanced metrics, and performance optimization.

I graduated from the University of California, Riverside (UCR), where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Statistics with a focus on Data Science. During my time at UCR, I developed a deep passion for sports analytics, drawn by the intersection of numbers and competition. UCR's strong emphasis on both theoretical and applied statistics gave me the foundation to build the analytical skills I use today in the fast-paced world of professional sports.

While at UCR, I was involved in various projects that combined statistical modeling with real-world applications. I had the opportunity to work on independent research projects and collaborate with professors, applying machine learning algorithms to sports dataâ€”especially in baseball. I analyzed performance metrics, player tracking data, and game statistics. This hands-on experience only deepened my interest in baseball, and I became fascinated by how data could be used to better understand and predict the performance of players and teams.

After graduation, I decided to pursue a career in baseball analytics. I gained experience through internships and freelance work with local baseball teams, sports agencies, and analytics firms. These early roles allowed me to refine my skills in data wrangling, data visualization, and predictive modeling using tools such as R, Python, SQL, and advanced Excel. As the sports industry increasingly embraced analytics, I honed my expertise in evaluating advanced metrics like OPS+, WAR (Wins Above Replacement), and FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching), as well as working with player tracking data from tools like Statcast.

Today, I serve as an MLB Data Analyst, where I play a key role in helping teams optimize lineups, improve player development, and identify key performance trends. Whether I'm diving into a pitcherâ€™s spin rate, analyzing the impact of defensive shifts, or building predictive models for player performance over the course of a season, I approach each task with a data-driven mindset. My work helps coaches and executives make informed, strategic decisions that align with long-term team goals and ensure success in a competitive environment.

Over the course of my career, I've developed a reputation for my ability to clearly communicate complex analytical concepts. One of my key strengths is translating numbers into actionable insights for coaches, front office executives, and players. Iâ€™m passionate about fostering collaboration and contributing to an innovative, team-oriented culture in the MLB analytics space.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m an avid baseball fan who stays up-to-date on the latest trends in sabermetrics. I enjoy contributing to online forums and writing blog posts where I share insights on emerging data trends and developments in baseball analytics.
